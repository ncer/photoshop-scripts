### Installing a Photoshop Script
1. Close Photoshop if it is open.
2. Copy the script and its ‘Scripts Only’ folder to the Scripts folder in your Photoshop installation directory.
  - On Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop CS[x]\Preset\Scripts.
  - On a MAC  : Applications > Photoshop CS[x] -> Presets -> Scripts.
3. Open Photoshop.
4. The script will now appear on the File > Scripts menu and can be run from here at any time.
 
### Running a Photoshop Script without Installing
1. Open Photoshop.
2. Select File -> Scripts -> Browse and navigate to the "script_name.jxs" file.
 
### Running a script from a shortcut
Many applications have shortcuts or hot keys to allow you to access frequently used functionality faster. If you install your script to the File -> Scripts menu you can allocate a keyboard shortcut to run the script using the instructions below.

1. Launch the keyboard shortcuts dialog by clicking Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. Under "Application Menu Command" open the entry for "File".
3. Scroll down, past "Scripts" until you see the name of your script.
4. Click the blank area for the script's shortcut.
5. Type the required shortcut. You can choose any combination of keystrokes as long as the following two points are met:
  - You must include "Ctrl" or a function key.
  - Do not use "Alt". This will launch the script in ‘Debug’ mode, rather than run it properly.
6. When finished, click OK.

_If there is a conflict between your chosen combination and an existing shortcut, a message will appear at the bottom of the dialog._
